# FSM Simulator

FSM Simulator is a web-based application designed to simulate finite state machines (FSMs). It provides users with tools to visualize, design, and analyze state transitions in FSMs. The project leverages modern libraries and frameworks for dynamic and interactive functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fsm-simulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fsm-simulator
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Features
- Visualize FSM state transitions.
- Design FSMs interactively using tools like Cytoscape and D3.js.
- Analyze FSMs for valid state transitions.
- Support for rendering FSMs with libraries like Viz.js and Dagre.
- Intuitive user interface built with React and styled using TailwindCSS.
